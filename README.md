Intructions on how to execute this code:
 Step 1. Open up an IDE of your choosing.
         It needs to be able to compile atleast C++ 11.

 Step 1. You will see a small menu with three options.

 Step 2.1. If you chose the example project, you will be asked to
           name the new file, where the schedule will be stored.
		   Enter the name of your file. Do not forget to add ".csv"
		   to your answer.
		   Your file is now in the program directory.
		   Then you will be presented with a choice to execute
		   the bonus task. If chosen "y", you will face the same
		   query to enter the name of your file. It will occur twice,
		   so enter the same file name twice. Do not forget to add ".csv"
		   to your answer. Your file is now in the program directory.
		   If declined the program ends.

		  a valid .txt file name. Check the given exampleData.txt for
		  formatting help regarding the variables of your own .txt file.
		  Then you will be asked to
